# CLTFanC

In 2022, the city of Charlotte got a new soccer team, Charlotte Football Club.
The team has created an application to connect fans to the lastest news and updates from the team.
In my opinion, the application they made was not a great application from the perspective of a user.

CLTFanc is my attempt at creating the app in a way that would be more intuitive to use and lead to a better user experience.
This was done in SwiftUI in order to push my knowledge of the framework.
